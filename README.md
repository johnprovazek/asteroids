## Description

This project is a recreation and expanded upon version of the classic Atari 2600 game Asteroids.
This project was developed for a computer graphics course at CSU Chico. 

Built using vanilla javascript and WebGL.

## Usage


### Controls: 

- WASD to move.
- Mouse to aim.
- Left-click to shoot. 

To restart the game you will need to refresh the page.

## Credits

The following resources were taken from the book "WebGL Programming
Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL" writen by Kouichi Matsuda
& Rodger Lea:

- cuon-matrix.js
- cuon-utils.js

- webgl-utils.js

## Bugs & Improvements

- The first few moves of the game will push the ship out too far.
- Fix code so you don't need to refresh to replay.
- Implement a leaderboard.

## License

No License for now until I have a better understanding of this. Would like this to be free for non commercial use.
