# Asteroids

A recreation and expanded upon version of the classic Atari 2600 Asteroids game.
These games were both developed with WebGL and javascript.

## Getting Started

To run on your own computer launch chrome from the command line with the
argument "–allow-file-access-from-files", then open either of the html files.
This argument allows chrome to access files from your computer. If you are
concerned about security the code is additionally hosted online:
